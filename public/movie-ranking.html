<h1>The Best Movies According to Patsy</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shrek (All of Them)</h3>
    <p>This movie series is a classic. It has my exact type 
        of humor and it never fails to crack me up. It is 
        definitely a comfort film of mine.

<h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>
    <p>I honestly haven't even seen this movie, but I 
        have seen how much it is touching people and it's
        definitely one I want to see even though I don't
        really watch movies anymore.

<h3>NULL</h3>
    <p>This is not a movie title. I just don't have any
        more that I am crazy about.
